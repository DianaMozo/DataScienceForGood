Examples Humanity's Biggest Challenges & Data Science

Global Challenge #8
How can the threat of new and reemerging diseases and immune microorganisms be reduced?

Question
Progress & Climate Change are changing our environment. How is  delicate balance of our ecosystem been impacted?
Hypothesis
Can you identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee?
Wild bees are important pollinators and the spread of colony collapse disorder has only made their role more critical. 
Right now it takes a lot of time and effort for researchers to gather data on wild bees. Using data submitted by 
citizen scientists, Bee Spotter is making this process easier. However, they still require that experts examine and 
identify the bee in each image. You're goal is to build an algorithm to help.
The starting point is to determine the genus—Apis (honey bee) or Bombus (bumble bee)—based on photographs of the insects.
